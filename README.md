# SDL Tutorial for your Android Projects

This repository contains the source code and instructions from the SDL Tutorial for your Android Projects, as demonstrated in the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSBISI0sCqo).

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to integrate the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library into your Android projects. SDL is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

## Features

- Setting up SDL in an Android project
- Basic example of SDL usage
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- Android SDK
- SDL2 library

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

## System Requirements

The version of Android Studio used in this project is 2024.1.2

Since this project uses an older version of SDL the project requires java version 8. Download it from [OpenJDK](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=436&field_architecture_target_id=391&field_java_package_target_id=All) and install it. After installing it, change the JDK which Android Studio is using by going **File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle** and change the Gradle SDK to the local directory of the JDK like ```C:\Program Files\OpenLogic\jdk-version```.

You need to install the desired Android SDK for the device you want, in this example we are using API level 17, so to install one go to **File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > C++ > Android SDK** and choose your desired device, in our case since we are using API level 17 we select the option ```Android 4.2 ("Jelly Bean")```

**Note:** This project only was tested in versions of API level 17 and 30.

Lastly what u will need to do is to change the gradle version of the gradle-wrapper.properties to use the version 4.8.1, like this: 
```
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.8.1-bin.zip
```

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SDL-Android-Tutorial.git
    cd SDL-Android-Tutorial
    ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio:**

    Launch Android Studio and open the project from the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Setup SDL:**

    Download the SDL2 library from the [SDL website](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and follow the instructions to include it in your project. Refer to the YouTube tutorial for detailed steps.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Connect your Android device or start an Android emulator.
2. Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio or use the following command:

    ```sh
    ./gradlew installDebug
    ```

This will compile and install the app on your connected device or emulator.
